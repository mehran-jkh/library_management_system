adding Sessionmanager-class later

studing bean life-cycle and its annotations later ...

it seems to this method of securing end-points is very pussy-poem because some of the actions does not have
simply a page... (one approuch is to treat those end-points like a page  and store them in db)


later resuming  searching about internal work-flow of mvc and webmvc configurer interface .

what is javax ??

--->> configuring the model-mapper tomorrow
--->> research about scope=request,session // in the video on youtube
--->> research about groups and payload parameter in annotations... // it is not so important
--->> trimming the app later after implementing main parts of the project
--->> adding log4j for example in some places for example in initbinder methods ...
--->> adding global error to binding result and displaying them in jsp page...
--->> <spring:hasBinderror /> tag and generally <spring:> tag in jsp
--->> the Find byID method is subject to error because the id may not exist...
--->> probably we can subsituate the hashmaps with enum for searchfields and other purposes...
